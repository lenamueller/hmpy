# Ideas and agends

## 1. file handling
- [ ] input: read tables from csv or txt
- [ ] output: write report

## 2. exploratory data analysis
1.  structure investigation:
- [ ] format
- [ ] size
- [ ] data types: numerical (continuous, discrete) / categorical (binary,ordinal)
- [ ] scales
2. quality investigation:
- [ ] data gap (e.g. missing date or missing value)
- [ ] missing values (e.g. -999)
- [ ] duplicates
- [ ] homogenity test of time series
3. content investigation:
- [ ] frequency distribution
- [ ] correlation
- [ ] patterns
## 3. data cleaning
- [ ] delete duplicates and irrelevant information
- [ ] At which levelof completness data rows or cols should be deleted?
- [ ] correction: mean, fit to periodogram, idw, kriging, inhomogenity
- [ ] precipitation correction after Richter

## 4. data analysis

### general statistics
- [ ] mean, mode, median, stdev, range, variance, 
- [ ] empirical distribution

### hydrology-specific
- [x] calc. principal values
- [ ] calc. and plot partial series
- [x] plot hydroraph 
- [ ] plot hydrograph with precipitation at top axis
- [x] plot summation curve
- [x] plot duration curve
- [ ] calc. independent events

### meteorology-specific
- [ ] atmospheric sounding
- [ ] wind rose
